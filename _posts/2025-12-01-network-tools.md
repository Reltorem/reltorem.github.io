**Network Tools**


There are many useful network tools that are frequently used by an IT professional. Some of the most common include:


**Cable Crimper**

- A handheld tool used to attach modular plugs (e.g., 8P8C 'RJ45') to twisted-pair cable by pressing the contacts into the conductors and locking the plug onto the jacket.
- Can sometimes strip cable as well.


**WiFi Analyser**

- Either software or a hardware handheld meter that scans and analyses wireless channels to show signal strength, channel use, interference, and neighbouring networks.
- Helps optimise access point placement and channel selection.


**Tone Generator/Probe**

- Handheld tool used to trace unknown cables through walls, ceilings, or patch panels.
- The tone generator plugs into a cable at one end and sends an audible signal down a cable pair.
- The probe detects it without direct contact with the copper - just hold the probe to the cable at the other end and listen for the tone.


**Punchdown Block**

- A termination block (such as 110 or Krone) where twisted-pair cables are seated using a punchdown tool.
- Maintains reliable, structured, permanent connections while preserving pair twist.
- In an office, desks usually all connect permanently to the punchdown block then cables can be further connected to switches from the other side, as well as moved or managed.
- It is important to maintain cable twists right up to the termination - even a few cm of early untwist can affect some cables like Cat. 6A.
- Tag or document everything and keep all cables as neat and organised as possible.


**Cable Testers**

- Handheld devices ranging from simple continuity testers to advanced certifiers that verify pair order, shorts, opens, split pairs, signal quality, and whether the link meets Cat5e/6/6A standards.
- Some cable testers might also have a tone generator built in and vice-versa.


**Loopback Plug**

- A small plug that routes TX (transmit) pins back to the RX (receive) pins.
- A bit like 'plugging a port into itself'.
- Used to test NICs, switch ports, and link operation without another device connected.


**Tap**

- A device that sits in the middle of a connection and copies traffic from a link to a monitoring port without interfering with the data flow.
- Used for packet capture, security and forensics.


**Port Mirror**

- A built-in switch feature that duplicates traffic from one or more ports or VLANs to another port so a capture tool or analyzer can inspect the packet.
- Essentially just using the switch as a tap.
- Creates a copy of the passing frames and mirrors it to another analysis port.
