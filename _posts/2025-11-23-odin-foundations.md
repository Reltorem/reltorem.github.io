**I completed The Odin Project's developer foundations path.**

I learnt the introductory knowledge and tools used in web development and coding including:

- Using code editors (VSCode)
- Git and GitHub
- SSH
- Installing and using Linux distros (I used Ubuntu and Pop!_OS)
- Dual-booting OS and disk partition management
- Command line basics in Linux and Windows
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Chrome dev tools
- Bug fixing and troubleshooting code

 I also completed some hands-on coding projects and built some of my own additional webpages to practice.

I used what I learnt to deploy and manage this static learning log website. It is hosted through GitPages as a git repository. I at least use PowerShell, VSCode, Jekyll, HTML and CSS every time I navigate, sync, locally test or edit anything to do with this site.
