**Wireless Network Technologies**


Many of the wireless communication standards that everyone follows globally are defined by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) which is based in America.

The 802 family includes technology standards such as:
- 802.3 (Ethernet)
- 802.11 (WiFi and WLAN)
- 802.15 (Wireless PAN)

The 802.11 standards that govern WiFi is managed by the 802.11 committee.

Over time, the standard has evolved and improved. The committee introduced a WiFi Generation naming scheme for clarity:

- 802.11ac (WiFi 5)
- 802.11ax (Wifi 6)
- 802.11be (WiFi 7)

802.11 operates on different frequency ranges:

- 2.4GHz (2.400 to 2.4835 GHz)
- 5GHz (5.150 to 5.850 GHz)
- 6GHz (5.925 to 7.125 GHz)

Sometimes a combination can be used at the same time.

Channels are groups or bands of frequencies.
The IEEE gives frequencies channel names, again for clarity.

e.g.
- 2.437 GHz = Channel 6
- 5.220 GHz = Channel 44

Channels are typically blocks of 20, 40, 80 or 160 MHz.

2.4 GHz WiFi ranges from 2.400 to 2.4835 GHz, so there are 3 non-overlapping 20 MHz channels.

5 GHz WiFi ranges from 5.150 to 5.850 GHz so it has much more room for many more 20 MHz channels, as well as 40, 80 and 160 MHz channels.

The bigger the channel, the more through-put and the faster the data transfer - just the same as how having a wider pipe means more fluid through-put.

Many devices were dumped onto the 2.4 GHz band as it was never regulated particularly strictly, so there is a lot of interference and speeds are slower.

5GHz is better regulated and has more bandwidth and channel options meaning less interference and faster speeds.

6GHz is faster still.

**Bluetooth**


Bluetooth used to be managed by IEEE under the 802.15.1 standard, but is now managed by a different entity focused on bluetooth.

It operates on the 2.4GHz band. Same technology standard as 802.11.

It is short-range, only up to about 10m

**RFID**


RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) is small lighweight wireless communication technology that is used for many different things such as:

- Pet ID chips
- Tracking chips
- Access passes and badges

Some chips are battery powered. Many are instead unpowered, but receive power from the radio energy of the connecting device when it comes near.

Communication is usually one-way.

**NFC**


NFC (Near Field Communication) is two-way communication that builds on NFC.

Very common in modern phones and smart watches, used for payment systems, ID systems and quick-setup for WiFi or Bluetooth devices.
