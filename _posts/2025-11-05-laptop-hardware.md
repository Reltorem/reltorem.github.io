**Laptop Hardware**


Laptop Hardware:

- General -
Smaller form-factor means smaller components.
e.g. Small Outline Dual In-Line Memory Module (SO-DIMM).

Discrete GPUs often are less powerful throttled mobile versions despite having the same branding.

Sometimes parts are easily replacable, sometimes it's soldered.

- Batteries -
Two main types of battery these days
- Lithium-Ion (Li-ion)
-Lithium-Ion polymer (LiPo)

These don't have a memory effect that locks it into shorter cycles like the old nickel-cadmium batteries.

Chemical wear means capacity is diminished over time though.
Best to keep Li-ion between 20% and 80%.


- Keyboard -
Usually pops out and has a ribbon cable connection.

Single keys can be more fiddly. Be careful and follow manufacturer procedures.

Plug in an external keyboard to help troubleshoot.

- Storage -
HDD: 3.5 inch for desktops, 2.5 inch for laptops.

SSDs are sometimes 2.5 inch, but now usually M.2 (much smaller form factor). Just plug it in.
Older 2.5 inch has 2 connections for data and power.

Upgrading HDD to SSD can be easily done by copying a system image over. Can either copy to a 3rd drive first or just plug both in and copy on the same machine.
SSDs often come with imaging software to make this easy.

- Connectivity - 
Wireless connectivity like Bluetooth and 802.11 Wifi is often built into motherboard.

Sometimes network cards are modular and can be swapped out, e.g. Mini PCI / Mini PCI Express.

The antennaes run up to the top of the screen. Often 2 for WiFi, 1 for Bluetooth.
WiFi is LAN (Local Area Network).
Bluetooth is often known as a PAN (Personal Area Network).

NFC is common in mobile devices like phones and watches.
