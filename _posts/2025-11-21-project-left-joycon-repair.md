**Nintendo Switch Left 'Joy-Con' Controller Repair**


**Aim**
- Diagnose and repair analog stick 'drift' on Nintendo Switch left 'Joy-Con' controller to restore original functionality.

**Tools**
- Phillips #00 screwdriver
- Tri-point Y00 screwdriver
- Spudger
- Tweezers

**Procedure**
- Observed phantom movement (drift) when using the Switch - system registers the stick pulling slightly to the left without touching it.
- Tried calibrating the stick in settings which did not solve the issue.
- Stick felt loose and likely needed replacing.
- Removed the analog stick component and replaced it with a new one with the following steps:


**1.**

- Using tri-point screwdriver, remove 4 tri-point Y00 screws from backplate and carefully prise open backplate, taking care not to damage the two ribbon cables still connecting it to the motherboard.
- Using a spudger, carefully lift up and disconnect the battery power connector.

**2.**
- Carefully prise out the battery pack and put it aside. It is stuck to the midframe underneath with light adhesive.

**3.**
- Open the midframe, taking care not to stress the ribbon cable that still connects it to the motherboard.

**4.**
- Using tweezers, open the ZIF (Zero Insertion Force) connectors on the midframe ribbon cable and the + button ribbon cable that runs over the analog stick housing.
- Pull out these two connectors and put the midframe aside.

*Note: The gold connection plating faces up on the midframe connector, and the plating faces down on the stick and + button connectors.*

*Note: At this point, note how the SL button fits into the controller housing. It can easily become dislodged. There is a small spring compressed beneath it and knocking the button out can eject the spring across the room and easily get lost. Either just safely remove it for now and replace on reassembly or be very careful not to disturb the button and spring.*


**5.**
- Using tweezers, open the ZIF connector and disconnect the analog stick housing from the motherboard.
- Remove the faulty stick component.

*Note: Take care not to move or damage the thin black mat sitting underneath the stick component housing.*

*Note: Dispose of the faulty analog stick or separate it so it doesn't get mixed up with good components.*


**6.**
- Place a new analog stick into the frame and perform each step in reverse to re-assemble the controller.

*Note: The ZIF connectors are fiddly. Take time to make sure they are securely connected and in the correct orientation. If the controller doesn't work at the end, that's the first thing that will need to be checked which means disassembling the controller again.*

*Note: Remember to replace the SL button if it was removed in step #4.*


**7.**
- Connect the Jon-Con to the Switch and pair it if required.
- The new stick will likely need to be calibrated before functioning properly.
- This calibration can be done in the Switch settings under 'Controllers and Sensors'.

**8.**
- Test in-game to confirm that the new analog stick functions properly and no longer drifts.

**Results**
- The faulty component was replaced succesfully.
- The controller no longer registers phantom movements.
- The stick is no longer loose and provides more precise and satisfying control, similar to when the device was new.

**Conclusion**
This repair showed correct handling of precision fasteners, safe disconnection of ribbon cables, and the ability to follow a structured troubleshooting process. Future repairs could be improved by carefully noting surrounding components that might be affected by the process (as in the case of the SL button and tensioner spring accidentally becoming dislodged). Clearer pictures could have been taken on a plain backdrop and a dedicated workspace with secure places for screws and components may also have been helpful.
