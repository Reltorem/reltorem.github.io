**NETWORK CABLES and ETHERNET**

Ethernet is a protocol and family of standards defined by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). It defines how signals are sent and processsed in a network.
It can run over *twisted pair, coaxial or fibre*. TP is by far the most common in home/office settings and coaxial is essentially obsolete.


*Twisted Pair (TP)*
- Copper wiring
- Most common network cabling in homes and offices.
- Cables: Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a, Cat7
- Connectors: RJ45
- Speeds: 10 Mbps - 10Gbps (10Gb possible over Cat6+)

*Coaxial (coax)*
- Copper wiring
- Early Ethernet standards used coax. Largely obsolete for Ethernet now.
- Speeds: 10 Mbps

*Fibre*
- Pulses of light
- Used in data centres, long-distance connections and high-speed data
- Speeds: 100 Mbps - 400Gbps+
- Connectors: LC, SC, ST
- Immune to EMI


**Twisted pair copper cabling**

- Multiple sets of colour-coded wire pairs twisted together.
- Each wire in a pair carries equal and opposite signals.
- Cabling signals are subject to random interference and noise from the environment, adjacent components and other wires.
- Twisting ensures that each wire in the pair has equal exposure to any source of interference so the 'noise' in each wire is effectively equal.
- To determine the real signal from the noise, the receiving end compares the difference in the two signals. Because the noise is virtually equal in each, it cancels out.

Example:

- The desired signal being sent on the cable is 2.0V
- Wire 1: +1V (+0.3V noise) = +1.3V
- Wire 2: -1V (+0.3V noise) = -0.7V
- 1.3V - (-0.7V) = 2.0V
- The receiving end interprets a signal of 2.0V

-*Shielding*-

These twisted pair cables can be shielded or unshielded. The shielding protects the cable from EMI (ElectroMagnetic Interference)

- **UTP (Unshielded Twisted Pair)** - Most common TP cabling.
- **STP (Shielded Twisted Pair)** - Requires the cable to be grounded.

Other abreviations (printed on cable jacket):

- (Overall cable) / (Individual pairs)TP

- U = Unshielded
- S = Braided shielding
- F = Foil shielding

E.g.

- S/FTP = Braided shielding around entire cable. Foil shielding on individual TPs.
- F/UTP = Foil sheilding around entire cable. Unshielded TPs.


**Coaxial copper cabling**

- Name comes from two components sharing a common axis:
- Copper wire conductor runs through the centre.
- Outer shielding runs along the outside of the inner wire core.
- Used to be a common Ethernet medium, but now mostly seen on cable modems.
- Also used for information other than networking, like television.


**Other special TP cabling**

Direct burial STP
- Designed to be directly buried without a conduit.
- Waterproof, strong, may be less flexible.
- May contain waterproof gel surrounding wires.
- Often contains a ground wire or *drain wire*.

Plenum-rated cable
- Plenum is the active air space above a drop roof.
- Cabling in this space must be fire-rated for safety.
- Cable jacket is made from FEP or low-smoke PVC.
- Traditional cable jackets are just regular PVC.
- Plenum-rated cable may be less flexible.


**Cable Categories**

When sending signals through copper cables, the cable itself has to be manufactured to a minimum standard (category) to support the type of signal that is required.

- These standards or cable categories are created by the IEEE.
- Consult the IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet) standards to determine what cable category you require for a particular system.

- 1 Gigabit Ethernet is still pretty much the standard in homes and offices.
- Speed: 1Gbps (1,000 Mbps)
- IEEE Shorthand: **1000BASE-T** (*1000*Mbps-*BASE*BAND-*T*wisted pair)
- Minimum cable category: **Cat5e** (Cat5 is older obsolete standard)
- Max cable distance: 100m


- 10 Gigabit Ethernet is more common in enterprise backbones, data centres and server rooms.
- Speed: 10Gpbs (10,000 Mbps)
- IEEE Shorthand: **10GBASE-T**
- Minimum cable category: Cat6
- Max cable distance: 55m UTP Cat6, 100m STP Cat6, 100m Cat6A

Homes and offices will typically use speeds of 1Gbps or 10Gbps.
- They will therefore use copper TP categories Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6a & Cat7.
- Cat8 is used for high speeds (25 - 40 Gbps) over short distances (max 30m) and so is typically only found connecting components in data centres or server rooms.


**TP Wire Colour Standards - 568A and 568B**

- The wires in twisted pair copper cabling are colour coded.
- The two standards are *T568A* and *T568B*. These are international.
- T568A is newer and recommended for new installations in Australia.
- They do exactly the same job however, so it doesn't particularly matter as long as the wiring scheme is consistent throughout a particular system.
- When you terminate an Ethernet cable, you must ensure the colours are punched into the correct positions in the connector.
- Jacks and connectors sometimes have the A/B scheme printed on them.
- Both ends of the cable should follow the same standard.

<img src="\images\t568a-t568b-wiring-diagram.png" alt="A diagram showing t568A and t568B wire colour schemes.">

As can be seen in the above diagram, the blue (1) and brown (4) positions are the same, while only the orange and green positions are altered.

- Cross-over cables with different ends exist, but are unnecessary these days.


**Fibre Optics**

Instead of sending a signal down a copper wire, we can send pulses of light through fibre optic wires. This is much faster (speed of light) and is not affected by radio interference.

- A light source at one end (LED or laser) fires light through a narrow high reflective inner core which contains the photons.
- Surrounding the high reflective inner core is a low reflective cladding.
- Surrounding all that is a buffer coating for protection.

There are two main types of fibre cables:

*Multi-mode Fibre*
- Large inner code means the light can bounce along multiple modes or different paths. 
- Short-range (max 2km)
- Short-range means cheaper light source - LED

*Single-mode Fibre*
- Narrow core means the light takes one mode or path down the centre.
- Long-range (~100km before regenerating signal)
- Long-range means more expensive light source - Laser

**PERIPHERAL CABLES**

*USB (Universal Serial Bus)*

- USB sends data serially - one bit at a time.
- The physical connector type and the USB protocol/specification are separate things. 

Connector = the shape of the plug.
- USB-A
- USB-B
- Micro-USB
- USB-C

A connector only defines the physical form factor and pin layout. Same connector does NOT guarantee the same protocol.

Protocol/spec = the data standard running over the connector.
- USB 2.0 (480 Mbps)
- USB 3.0 / 3.2 Gen 1 (5 Gbps)
- USB 3.2 Gen 2 (10 Gbps)
- USB 4 (20 or 40 Gbps)

The protocol defines speed, features, power delivery, and signaling. The same protocol can run over different connectors.

- The USB protocol naming scheme is a bit of a confusing mess, frankly.
- It may be easier to refer to USB type by speed - ie. USB 5Gbps, USB 10Gbps, etc.

<img src="\images\usb-connectors.jpg" alt="A chart showing the different types of usb connectors.">

USB-C as a connection type is rapidly becoming the global standard. It can be used for data, power, video, audio, HDMI, Thunderbolt, etc.


*Thunderbolt*

Thunderbolt is a highspeed serial connector with data and power on the same cable.
- It is a different protocol to USB, but now uses USB-C connector.
- Thunderbolt 1 & 2 were based on Mini DisplayPort connector.
- Thunderbolt 4 supports 40Gbps over 3m copper/60m optical. Daisy-chaining up to 6 devices. Dual 4k displays.

**VIDEO CABLES**


*HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface)*
- All-digital video and audio stream.
- 19-pin connector.
- Max cable distance ~20m

*DisplayPort*
- Compatible with HDMI and DVI via passive adaptor.
- Full-size DisplayPort and Mini DisplayPort connectors. Full-size has locking mechanism.
- DisplayPort can usually handle more data than HDMI

*DVI (Digital Visual Interface)*
- Older analog/digital video connection.
- Secured with 2 screws.
- Has many different connection types:

<img src="\images\DVI-connectors.png" alt="A chart showing the different DVI connector types.">

*VGA (Video Graphics Array)*
- Fully analog legacy video connection.
- DE-15 connection, 15 pin. Often inaccurately referred to as DB-15.
- Secured with 2 screws.
- Typically coloured blue.

**STORAGE CABLES**

*SATA/eSATA (external Serial Advanced Technology Attachment)*
- Standard interface for connecting storage drives to the motherboard inside a computer.
- Various revisions from 1.0 (1.5 Gbit/s, 1 metre) to 3.2 (16 Gbit/s, 1 metre).
- 2 connectors for POWER and DATA on storage drives: SATA Power is 15 pins (longer), SATA data is 7 pins (shorter). May also use Molex power connector.
- Power connector plugs directly to port from the PSU, Data connector plugs directly to port on the motherboard.
- Combined POWER/DATA combo cables exist, but aren't part of the standard SATA spec.
- eSATA connects external drives up to 2 metres. It has a very different connector shape. SATA has a more distinctive L-shape.
