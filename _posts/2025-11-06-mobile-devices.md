**Connection Types**


Many different connection types now:

- Mini USB
- Micro USB
- USB type-A
- Apple Lightning (not USB)
- USB C.

USB C is currently the standard.

- 24 pin connection
- Orientation agnostic
- Acts as USB 2.0/3.0/3.1/4
- Transmits different signals (DisplayPort, HDMI, Thunderbolt)
- Used for charging, data transfer, authentication, etc.

Bluetooth (PAN) - High speed, short range.

NFC - Small data volume, very short range (few cm).

Most modern phones with mobile data support Wifi hotspot/tethering to other devices (depends on provider).


**Accessories**


Examples of accessories include:

- Stylus (must be compatible)

- Hands-free Headset (USB wired, 3.5mm analog jack [Tip Ring Ring Sleeve TRRS], Bluetooth, USB Dongle)

- Docking station

- Port replicator

- External trackpad

- External drawing pad


**Mobile Device Networks**


Phone/Cell Networks:

Antennaes cover an area in cells.

Generations:

1G Analog voice (1980s)

2G Digital voice + SMS

3G Mobile internet (1998)

4G True broadband speeds. (LTE - Long Term Evolution).
Based on GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) / EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution)

LTE Advanced

5G Very low latency, high , much faster (2020)


**SIM (Subscriber Identity Module)**


Identifies you on mobile network.
Has a SIM ID and phone number attached to it, regardless of the device it's in.

Has small amount of storage for contacts, messages. etc.

Some new phones have an embedded eSIM which is non-removable.
Can be changed through software.

Some devices are dual-SIM (or maybe more).

**GPS**


- Created by US Defence Dep.
- Over 30 satellites in orbit.
- Needs at least 4 satellites for accurate position.
- Uses timing differences in signal bounces to infer location. '3D sphereical quadangulation'.
- Geotracking, mobile tower triangulation, etc. can also help pinpoint your location.

**WiFi**


802 standards developed by IEEE.
802.11 defines WiFi standards.

Requires local access point.
Often can make calls over VoIP through WiFi if 4G/5G mobile data is unavailable.


**Device Managemen**


MDM (Mobile Device Management)

Requires special software.

Set polices, push updates, configure settings, force security policies like PIN lock or 2FA, ban apps, partition the phone to separate personal data and company data.

You can set what data is synchonised and by what method.
e.g. only sync on WiFi not cellular or only sync at certain times of day to reduce costs and bandwidth use. 


Control company data on a personal device with:

- BYOD (Bring Your Own Device).

- COPE (Corporate Owned, Personally Enabled).

- CYOD (Choose Your Own Device). Similar to COPE but user chooses what device they want.
