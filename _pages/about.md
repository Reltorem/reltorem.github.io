G'day, I'm Ash.

I'm currently studying toward the CompTIA A+ certification and building practical IT skills through hands-on learning. This site serves as both a learning log and a technical exercise, where I document the concepts I'm studying and the practical work I'm completing along the way.

The content ranges from short reference notes to more detailed explanations and write-ups covering basic hardware, operating systems, and other IT fundamentals. The site itself is deployed using a custom Jekyll theme hosted through GitHub Pages,  and managed via the command-line as part of my learning process.

Posts are organised by category for easy browsing. Thanks for taking the time to read!
