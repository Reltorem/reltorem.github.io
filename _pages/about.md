G'day! My name is Ash.

I am studying to pass my CompTIA A+ certification.

Here I am logging all my learning and practicing deploying a web page through GitPages using the command line.

Some topics are quick notes, some are a bit more of an in-depth explanation. You can browse posts by category.

Thanks for reading!
